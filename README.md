# Transformer for English-to-Hindi Translation

This repository contains a Transformer model implemented from scratch to perform English-to-Hindi translation. The model is built using PyTorch and follows the Transformer architecture as described in the paper "[Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)". It uses custom tokenizers and layers to train on parallel corpora of English and Hindi sentences.

## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to build and train a Transformer model from scratch to translate English sentences into Hindi. It showcases how deep learning techniques such as attention mechanisms and positional encoding can be employed in natural language processing tasks.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/transformer-english-to-hindi.git
   cd transformer-english-to-hindi
2. **Install the required dependencies:**

Or manually install the necessary libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install torch tqdm numpy pandas matplotlib
```
Optional: Set up a virtual environment for isolation (recommended):

```github
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
## Usage
#Prepare the dataset:

- Make sure you have a parallel corpus of English-Hindi sentences.
Preprocess the dataset using tokenizers and save the preprocessed data in a suitable format (e.g., CSV, TXT).
Update the dataset paths in the notebook or script.
Run the Jupyter notebook:

- Open and run the provided Jupyter notebook:
```python
jupyter notebook transformer-english-to-hindi.ipynb
```
## Train the model:

Ensure the dataset paths, model configurations (e.g., number of epochs, batch size), and hyperparameters are correctly set in the notebook.
After training, the model weights will be saved to the specified directory.

# Translate a sentence:

- Use the trained model to translate an English sentence into Hindi:
```python

english_sentence = "How are you?"
translated_sentence = model.translate(english_sentence)
print(f"Translation: {translated_sentence}")
```
## Model Architecture
- The model follows the Transformer architecture with self-attention layers.
# Key components include:
- Multi-Head Attention
- Positional Encoding
- Feed-Forward Layers
- Residual Connections and Layer Normalization
- The architecture is designed to handle variable-length sequences and provides efficient parallelization during training.
# Training Process
- Optimizer: Adam optimizer with learning rate scheduling.
- Loss Function: Cross-Entropy loss with label smoothing.
- Training Data: The model is trained on parallel English-Hindi sentence pairs.
- Training Duration: The model is trained for a specified number of epochs with batch size tuning.
# Dataset
This model requires a parallel corpus of English-Hindi sentences.
Ensure that the dataset is tokenized and preprocessed before training.
## Results
After training, the model can translate English sentences to Hindi with reasonable accuracy.

## Sample translation results:

English Sentence	Hindi Translation
"How are you?"	"आप कैसे हैं?"
"The weather is nice."	"मौसम अच्छा है।"
